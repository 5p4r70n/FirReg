FIR Registration

this idea a based on of lot of incidents happening of chaning the fir records ,till now in police stations they are using FIR as a file becose of security matters if they changed to a website like expriment (not blockchain) thats is not fail or risk proof, So Im Start to thinking abt this... 


install Truffle ganache (https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) insted of geth im using this one (battery saves)

Clone the Git repositery

install needed npm packeges with "npm install"

blockchain folder conatains the contract files
Frontend folder contains the Frontend anguler 8
server folder contains node file

open ganache and start a project

goto blockchain folder and exicute this command "truffle migrate" 

goto server folder and exicute this command "node app.js"

goto Frontend folder and exicute this command" ng serve -o"

default browser window will open


enter "123" for login pass

there registerd cases will list
